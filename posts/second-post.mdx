# Welcome to the MDX Test Blog

This is a sample blog post written in MDX. It contains approximately 1500 words and is created to test the rendering of markdown and MDX components in a Next.js project using `next-mdx-remote`.

## Introduction

In modern web development, MDX is becoming a powerful tool for developers who want to mix JSX components with markdown. This test post includes everything from headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and code blocks to simulate a real blog post.

## Why This Blog Exists

This blog is purely for testing. Sometimes, you need a full post to see if your layout, typography, spacing, and image rendering work correctly. It helps test:

- Typography rendering
- Long content scroll
- Code syntax highlighting
- Image responsiveness
- Layout behavior

## Section One: Sample Image

Letâ€™s insert a test image to check responsiveness:

![Sample Image](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Test+Image)

The image should be full-width inside the `article` tag and should scale on different screen sizes.

## Section Two: Code Blocks

You might want to check how code syntax highlighting looks:

### JavaScript Example

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```
